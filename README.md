# Flight Price - Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Flight Price Dataset. This dataset contains a mixture categorical, temporal, and numerical features. Additionally, it also requires removal of redundant information along with converting features to proper data type for efficient data analysis. There are also some data entered in a different format that needs to be handled as well.

In this project, we perform:
* Imports - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
* Reading the csv.
* General dataset information/statistics.
* Converting date string to datetime variables.
* Splitting Date and Time to Date, Month, Year, Hour and Minute for efficient Machine Learning.

The Dataset is now ready to be split and scaled for Model Training.
